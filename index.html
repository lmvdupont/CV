    <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>Living a life dedicated to fulfilling ideas has been a long focus of mine. Ever since I was a child, I have
        strived to stay curious and to question the status quo. This has only been further enhanced by my studies at the
        University of Concordia, where I am pursuing a degree in International Business to gain a global understanding
        of business. Beyond my studies, I am also fortunate to serve as an Independent Director of the board of
        CASAJMSB, where I am responsible for voting on student-centric matters. Before moving to Montreal for
        university, I lived in Delaware, where I attended Salesianum High School. There I cultivated meaningful
        relationships, as well as a strong appreciation of my French heritage. My time in Delaware also provided me with
        the opportunity to take part in the sport of rowing, which taught me discipline and the value of teamwork. I am
        humbled to have experienced success both on and off the water. Moreover, I am constantly seeking new ways to
        challenge and grow myself. Through a combination of travel and reading, I am able to quench my curiosity and
        discover new perspectives. On my various journeys, I bring my Fujifilm to capture the progression of my life. My
        ambition drives me to be better, and I am committed to strengthening my body and mind.</p>
